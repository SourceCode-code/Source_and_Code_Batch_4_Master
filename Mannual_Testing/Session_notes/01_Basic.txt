// what is SDLC (Software development lifecyle ) and STLC (Software Testing lifecyle)?

SDLC is complete process step by step  by which we can create software

Phases in SLDC -->

1 Requirement Analysis :- In this phase we collect the data form the client/Stakeholder

2 Planning             :- in this pahse we do a feasbility (study , cost , timeline resources ) decison

3 Design               :-  this process is divded in to parts 

1 high level design  :- archecture , tech stacks  , documents 

2 low level desgin  :-  ui , database , services 

4 Development  (coding)--> in this phase the actual developement of the product starts   (coding )
 this phase is done developers 

5 Testing            :- in this phase we check the developed product is as per requirment  

6 Deployment        :- Realse this software ( ready to use ) 
 the product is given to the end user 

7 Maintance phase   :- fix issues  // any new update


//  STLC (Software Testing lifecyle) -->
STLC  is part of SDLC 
this is step by step process followed during the testing pahse of SLDC
STLC focus only Testing part 

1  Requirement Analysis :- Understand what is to be test 

2  Test Planning        :- under this process we create a plan ( we create documents )--> they called test plan document

( this document answer 4 major question )
1 what to test 
2 how to test 
3 when to test 
4 who will test it

3 Tescase design -->  in this phase we design testcase   ( step by step instruction how to test)  -- testcase document

4 enviornments Setup phase --> in the phase a qa enviornments 

5 Exceution --> the testing start  with the testcase 

6 defect reporting --> in this we communictae the to the deveoplr the issues or bugs in the software 

7 test closure --> summary  we give a go / no go signal
