// what branches on git and why is it nedded 

// if there is a team of 10 automation testors working on same project 
// everyone is working on default / main 
// while everyone try to push some error may occur or some issues maybe face 
// this can cause the code management an issue 


// to avoid this we have a concept in git called as branching

// branch --> branch is a copy of your main or defualt created to make changes 
// pull request --> a request made to merge your branch changes master
// conflict --> confilct is the problem arised when merging changes 
// merging --> process of adding the branch change to master
// review -> the process of checking the changes  added in the pull request
